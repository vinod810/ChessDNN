# DNN Chess Engine

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate 1) chess position evaluation using deep nueral netwrok (DNN) and 2) a chess engine that can play at a strength equal to an experience club player, i.e., about 1500 ELO rating strength.

## Description

The projects uses about 100 million chess postions to train a DNN that can evaluate a chess position. The chess engine ususes the chess postion evaluation provided by the DNN to decide the best move by eavaluating and ranking the resulting chess postions for each legal move.
